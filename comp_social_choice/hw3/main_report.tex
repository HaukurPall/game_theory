	\section{Introduction}
	It is clear from the Gibbard-Satterthwaite Theorem that any reasonable voting rule is in principle prone to manipulation. That is, there will be profiles for which some voters stand to improve the outcome of the vote by reporting dishonest preferences. It is unclear, however, how often such situations will arise in practice. We are therefore asked to assess and compare the \textit{Borda}, \textit{Plurality} and \textit{Copeland} rules with respect to their practical proneness to manipulability.
	
	There are various factors that could potentially influence the prevalence of manipulability: the number of candidates partaking in the election, the voting rule employed, the number of voters in the profile and assumptions concerning the distribution over possible profiles. In order to individually account for these factors we set up a logistic regression model. This allows us to seperately account for each factor's effect on the expected probability of a given profile-cum-voting rule being manipulable. 
	
	Using algorithms described in Section 2 we generated a data set in the following way:
	First, we randomly generated $100$ profiles for all either $6$ or $20$ candidates and between between $3$ and $1000$ voters.  Seconldy, we determined the winner in all of the profiles under each voting rule. Then we checked for each profile and voting rule whether some voter in the profile under consideration a) stands to gain from successful manipulation and b) has the powers to induce it. If both points are satisfied, then we declare the outcome manipulable, otherwise, we declare it non-manipulable. For each profile-voting rule pair we thus get a binary verdict: manipulable or not. The fraction of manipulable under some voting rule is be the voting rules practical proneness to manipulation.
	
	The report is structured as follows: The following Section provides some detail on the algorithms we used to determine the winners for a given profile-voting rule pair and whether said outcome can be manipulated. The third Section presents the results of the Logistic Regression Analysis and the fourth discusses them and concludes the report.
	\section{Determining Winners \& Manipulability}
	Given some profile $\mathbf{R}$ we determined the winner by assigning each candidate a counter on which we put points. The candidate with most points wins, ties are broken lexicographically. The points were awarded thus for the three rules:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Plurality}: A candidate's points is the number of times the candidate shows up in the first spot.
		\item \textit{Borda}: The points of a candidate are her Borda-score.
		\item \textit{Copeland}: A candidate's points are the number of pair-wise matchups a candidate wins minus the number of pair-wise matchups a candidate loses. (We view this rule effectively as a positional scoring rule. The scoring vector depends on the number of candidates - $|X|=x$ - and looks as follows: $s=(x-1, x-3, x-5, ..., -(x-3), -(x-1))$.)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\noindent The algorithms to determine the manipulability run as follows:\\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textit{Plurality}: \begin{enumerate}
			\item  Compute the respective margin of victory (MOV) between \textit{actual winner} and all other candidates. If MOV$>1$ for all candidates, then declare the profile-rule pair non-manipulable. (One invdividual voter whose first option is not the winner can at most 'push' another candidate by $1$ point. If the MOV is larger than this she can not manipulate successfully.) Put all the candidates for whome MOV$<2$ in a set of \textit{potential winners}. These are the candidates in 'striking distance' who could still be manipulated into winning.
			\item For all candidates in \textit{potential winners} look at each voter's profile and see if two conditions hold: \\
			a) The \textit{potential winner} is strictly preferred to the \textit{actual winner} by the voter under consideration.\\
			b) The \textit{potential winner} was not already ranked in the first position by the voter.\\
			If both conditions hold for some voter, then declare manipulability. Otherwise, declare non-manipulability.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item \textit{Borda}: \begin{enumerate}
			\item Compute the MOV for between all candidates and the \textit{actual winner}. If MOV$>x-2$ for all candidates, then declare the profile-rule pair non-manipulable. (One invdividual voter whose first option is not the winner can at most 'push' another candidate by $x-2$ point. If the MOV is larger than this she can not manipulate successfully.) Put all the candidates for whom MOV$<x-1$ in a set of \textit{potential winners}. These are the candidates in 'striking distance'.
			\item For all candidates in \textit{potential winners} look at each voter's profile and see if three conditions hold: \\
			a) The \textit{potential winner} is strictly preferred to the \textit{actual winner} by the voter under consideration.\\
			b) The \textit{potential winner} was not already ranked in the first position by the voter.\\
			If one of the conditions fails to hold, move to the next candidate. Otherwise, proceed in the following way:\\
			Move the \textit{potential winner} all the way to the top of the ballot under consideration. Put all the hopeless candidates (those who neither win nor are part of the \textit{potential winners} right below the candidate we are currently trying to promote. At the bottom of the ranking, moving the \textit{actual winner} successively one spot further back in the ranking. If for some constellation the \textit{potential winner} manages to win instead of the \textit{
				actual winner}, declare the profile manipulable. If for all candidates and all voters thus considered such a constellation cannot be found, declare non-manipulability.\\
			Note that this step-by-step approach is necessary. For suppose we simply put the \textit{actual winner} all the way to the bottom when checking for manipulability. Then situations such as the following could arise:\\
			Assume there are many candidates. The 3 candidates at the top of the Borda-score ranking - $A,B,C$ - have this many points:\\
			$A$ - $\alpha$\\
			$B$ - $\alpha-2$\\
			$C$ - $\alpha-1$\\
			Voter $i$ has the following ranking:\\
			$\text{some candidate}\succ B \succ A \succ \text{some candidate} \succ C \succ \text{some candidate} \succ ...$\\
			By moving $B$ to the top, $B$ now has $\alpha-1$ many points. If $i$ moves $A$ back one spot, then $A$ now has $\alpha-1$ points too (we could define this as having manipulated successfully, since the winner now depends on the tie breaking we perform). But if $i$ were to move $A$ further back still, then $C$ would have to move up, thus obtaining $\alpha$ many points and winning clearly. But $C$ is dispreferred by $i$, so this manipulation is not desirable for him.\\ In order to exclude cases like this one, we therefore need to move the \textit{actual winner} back cautiously and check at each step what happens  to the other candidates that are in striking distance of becoming the winners. On the other hand, we can move $B$ up with no further considerations, because this will at most hurt other candidates' Borda-score.
			\item 3. If a candidate can be found in the set of \textit{possible winners} who a) is preferred by some voter to the actual winner and b) will become the winner by moving him to the top and the \textit{actual winner} downwards, then declare the profile manipulable. Otherwise, declare it non-manipulable.
		\end{enumerate}
		\item \textit{Copeland}: This works essentially the same as what we use for Borda-manipulability. The only difference is that, instead of the Borda scoring vector, we use the the scoring vector we introduced earlier to determine the winner for a specific profile.
	\end{itemize}
	\section{Logistic Regression}
	
	We used the algorithms described earlier to generate a large amount of data on manipulability. Next, we would like to know how probable it is that a profile with a given number of candidates and voters is manipulable under our three voting rules. Furthermore, we would like to compare the impact the choice of voting rule has on manipulability and how high our confidence in this impact should be as compared to pure accident. Finally, we would like to compare the importance of voting rules with respect to manipulability to the impact of other factors such as the number of voters and the numbers of profiles.
	The adequate tool to answer these questions is regression analysis. Since our dependent variable (manipulable? yes/no) is a binary, categorical variable, we should not use simple linear regression since it is unlikely to yield a good fit. Instead the method of choice is logistic regression.
	
	Logistic regression makes use of the standard logistic function to turn binary output into real output. Namely \[F(x)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(\beta_0+\beta_1+...)}}\] yields a regression model where F(x) can be interpreted as the probability of
